function [nsigma]=Nsigmaest2(Nimg)
% nsigma = Nsigmaest2 (Nimg);
% 
% estimates the noise standard deviation from an (MRI) image (2D) corrupted with
% Rician noise based on the skewness of the distribution. This method
% dosen't depend on the background for noise estimation. Can be used for
% MR images with and without background.
%
% Input : Nimg is the noisy image;
